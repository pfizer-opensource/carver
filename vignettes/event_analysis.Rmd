## 1. Introduction

This document details the steps for creating Event Analysis Plot using carver application which is a graph report. The required input ADaM data for this is an ADAE dataset.

### 1.1 Report Inputs in App

Upon loading/selecting `ADAE` data  
  - Report Type as `Figure` and Report Name as `Event Analysis` for the graph  
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("event_analysis_reportname.png")
```

**Treatment/Population**  
*Required*  

  - Under Treatment and Population Selection, select appropriate `Treatment Variable`:   
    For table, Treatment Variable determines the columns and for Figure, determines how to         differentiate groups by color.
    
  - Select appropriate `Treatment Sort Variable` which will give the order for sorting             Treatment variable.
  
  - To subset entire data based on population flags, select `Population Filter`. eg. Overall,      Safety (SAFFL).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("adaebox_treatment.png")
```

**Processing Data:**  

  - Add or Edit the default `Analysis Subset Condition` and `Denominator Subset Condition` to      filter input data (for calculating categorical counts alone or for entire data                 respectively)
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("event_analysis_03.png")
```

  - Select `Adverse Event Filter(s)` - To filter input data

  - Select `Period` - To generate the figure by either `Overall Duration` or `Other`.
  
  - Select `Higher Level Event Term` - This variable will help to generate the figure by          AEBODSYS or FMQ Name etc., It shows the main bar chart of the percentages of subjects with     at least one AE, by AEBODSYS or FMQ Name etc., and treament group.
  
  - Select `Lower Level Event Term` - This variable will help to generate the figure by           AEDECOD or AELLT etc., It shows the main bar chart of the percentages of subjects with        at least one AE, by AEDECOD or AELLT etc., and treatment group. 
  
 - Select `Reference Line (%)` - Reference lines show how the data in a chart compares to a      reference value. This is free text column where you can enter any number as reference         value. 
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("event_analysis_04.png")
```

**Graph Output:**

- Click `Process Report Input` button and switch to `Graph Output` tab to update the inputs below and generate the graph.
  
 - Select `Event Higher Classification` - This is related to the `Higher Level Event Term` variable. It creates a drop down of the variable values selected in the `Higher Level Event Term`. 
 
  - Select `Event Term` - This is related to the `Lower Level Event Term` variable. It creates a drop down of the variable values selected in the `Lower Level Event Term`. 
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("event_analysis_new_2.png")
```



```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("event_analysis_new_3.png")
```
