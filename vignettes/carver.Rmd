## **1. Overview**

carver application helps to explore data visually and makes it easier to identify interesting data patterns.

By uploading data locally or can use default CDISC data, user can explore relevant tables, listings, and figures by giving their own inputs, thus interacting with the data and the analysis.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("carver1look.png")
```

This is the look and feel of the carver application initially when one loads the app. Now that the app is ready to use, the user needs to feed in the data for which the report and graphs are visualized. There are 4 tabs in the main window: `Report Inputs` to give inputs for reports, `Data Check` to view the reported values for the selected variable, `Graph Output` to display any graph generated, and `Table Output` to display any table generated.

### 1.1 Data Import

Data can be uploaded from *Local* location. The file can only be of ".csv", ".sas7bdat", ".xpt" and ".Rda" format and must follow the naming convention of "adXX" where "XX" is the domain code. For example, "adae.sas7bdat" and "adae.xpt" are valid whereas "adae_s1.sas7bdat" or "adae2.sas7bdat" are not valid. In the *Data Source* panel, you can see the following options: Default and Local.

|     |
|-----|
|     |



#### 1.1.1 Default CDISC data

This option provides an opportunity to work with the built-in dataset in the carver application. Default option includes ADSL and ADAE dataset. For example, to start working with "ADSL" dataset, choose "ADSL" from C`DISC ADaM Data` dropdown and then click on "Read Data".

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("adaereadpic.png")
```

Before process or create a report, click on "Report Inputs" tab. This step provides available options to create or process a report.

|     |

## **4. Listings and Patient Profile (For Adverse Events figures only)**

The 3 Adverse Events Figure reports - Forest Plot, Volcano Plot and Event Analysis - have an added feature of being able to view the listing and relevant patient information from the main plot.  
Clicking on a point or bar of interest in any of the 3 plots will result in creation of a listing of all participants in the data with the selected Event Classification and Treatment group with relevant info such as Outcomes, Severity, Event Start and End Dates etc. This is displayed as a table below the plot.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("listing_1.png")
```

Further, clicking on any one of the rows in the listing results in creation of a figure (interval plot) for each participant which illustrates the start, end date and interval during which the selected patient experienced any adverse events.  
Additionally, if `CM` or `ADCM` data is loaded in the app, the above-mentioned graph overlays another figure displaying similar intervals for when the participant was on concomitant medications. This figure is displayed below the listing.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("profile_1.png")
```

## **5. Usage Notes and Common Errors**

-   When subset conditions, population or adverse event filters are selected, check that there is any data within those filters. If not, reports may fail or display a message that there is no data.

-   For running an analysis with pooled data, user has the option to give STUDYID as Treatment Variable.

-   If the app fails at some point, the 'Logs' in R Studio Connect or R Studio can also give a clue about the source of the error.
