Clinical Analysis Reporting and Visualization Ensemble in R

## Purpose

Development of an open-source tool and package to enable generation of
identified interactive plots for clinical review and direct inclusion in
submission for regulatory agencies. The scope includes Shiny application
for complete safety report generation from Analysis Model (ADaM)
datasets.

### Dependencies

The latest version of the package works with the latest versions of the
packages stated in `DESCRIPTION`.

If a previous version of the package should be used, it is recommended
to use latest version of the dependencies at the point of time when the
previous version of {carver} was released.

## Scope

-   Build a toolbox of re-usable functions and utilities to create
    Clinical Domain tables and figures.
-   Clinical Domain datasets which are used to create tables and figures
    should follow CDISC standards.
