</h3>
<p>Before creating Adverse Events <code>tornado plot</code>, it’s
essential to use the <code><a href="../reference/process_tornado_data.html">process_tornado_data()</a></code>. This function
helps prepare the data for visualization, making it a crucial step. With
this function, users can customize many parts of the plot to match their
specific data and analysis needs.<br>
While it is recommended that this be used for Oncology data, it can also
work with non-Therapeutic Area specific ADaM datasets, which is shown in
this example.<br>
This function block consists mainly <code><a href="../reference/adsl_merge.html">adsl_merge()</a></code>,
<code><a href="../reference/ae_pre_processor.html">ae_pre_processor()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/mentry.html">mentry()</a></code> functions to
combine ADSL variables, perform adverse-event specific pre-processing
and filter records/set grouping variables. It also filters out the
maximum severity based on the given inputs. Below, we’ll explain the
parameters used in <code>process_tornado_data</code>:-</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>dataset_adsl</code>: This parameter is used to pass the
variable containing <code>ADSL</code> dataset.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dataset_analysis</code>: This parameter is used to pass the
variable containing analysis dataset. In this example, <code>ADAE</code>
dataset.</p></li>
<li><p><code>adsl_subset</code>: This parameter specifies subset
condition(s) for the <code>ADSL</code> dataset. It allows the user to
filter data before plotting.</p></li>
<li><p><code>analysis_subset</code>: Similar to
<code>adsl_subset</code>, this parameter specifies subset condition(s)
for the analysis dataset.</p></li>
<li><p><code>split_by</code>: This parameter is used for splitting the
data by a specific variable. The default value is
<code>NA_character_</code> which suggests that by default, there’s no
splitting. If a variable is provided, it would split the data
accordingly. Example: Region - separate plots would be generated for
each region.</p></li>
<li><p><code>trtvar</code>: This parameter represents the treatment
variable. It indicates the variable that represents different treatments
or groups in the data.</p></li>
<li><p><code>trt_left</code>: This parameter represents the treatment
value. It indicates the value that displays on the left hand side of the
plot.</p></li>
<li><p><code>trt_right</code>: This parameter represents the treatment
value. It indicates the value that displays on the right hand side of
the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><code>trtsort</code>: This parameter is used for sorting the
treatment variable.</p></li>
<li><p><code>obs_residual</code>: This parameter is used to pass a
period (numeric) to extend the observation period. If passed as NA,
overall study duration is considered for analysis. eg. if 5, only events
occurring upto 5 days past the TRTEDT are considered..</p></li>
<li><p><code>fmq_data</code>: This parameter is required if FMQ terms
are to be used as high or low terms, the
<code>FMQ_Consolidated_List</code> should be passed. Default value is
<code>NULL</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ae_catvar</code>: This parameter is used for series
categorical variable for severity analysis and filter out the maximum
severity.</p></li>
<li><p><code>denom_subset</code>: This parameter is a condition which is
used to subset data set for calculating denominator. Default value is
<code>NA</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>pctdisp</code>: This parameter is a method that is used to
calculate denominator (for %). Valid values: <code>"TRT"</code>,
<code>"VAR"</code>, <code>"COL"</code>, <code>"SUBGRP"</code>,
<code>"CAT"</code>, <code>"NONE"</code>, <code>"NO"</code>,
<code>"DPTVAR"</code>, <code>"BYVARxyN"</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>legendbign</code>: This parameter determines whether
<code>N</code> should be displayed in the legend. The default value is
<code>Y</code> which suggests that by default, <code>N</code> is
displayed in legend. Default value is <code>N</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>yvar</code>: This parameter represents the variable to be
plotted on the y-axis. The default value is <code>AESOC</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Default/Example values are provided to give users a starting
point. However, these values can be modified as necessary to better suit
the specific data and visualization objectives.</p>
<p>The first step for creating <code>tornado_plot</code> for Adverse
Events is to read the required datasets into the environment. In this
example, <code>ADSL</code> and <code>ADAE</code> are used.</p>
<p>Below is an example of calling <code>process_tornado_data</code>
function for preprocessing the data for tornado plot.</p>

<p>The <code>tornado_plot</code> function is designed to create flipped
bar plots from input data, with customizable options. It offers
flexibility in plotting data and allows users to tailor the plot
aesthetics to their preferences. The parameters used in
<code>tornado_plot</code> are explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>datain</code>: The input data for plotting. The output data
from process_tornado_data function.</p></li>
<li><p><code>trt_left_label</code>: This parameter is used to label the
<code>trt_left</code> in the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><code>trt_right_label</code>: This parameter is used to label the
<code>trt_right</code> in the plot..</p></li>
<li><p><code>bar_width</code>: Bar width option. This parameter allows
customization of the bar width displayed on the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><code>axis_opts</code>: List of options for axis appearance. This
parameter allows customization of the appearance of the x-axis and
y-axis, including labels, and other options retrieved from
plot_axis_opts().</p></li>
<li><p><code>legend_opts</code>: List of options for legend appearance.
This parameter allows customization of the legend displayed on the plot,
including its label, position, and direction.</p></li>
<li><p><code>series_opts</code>: Vector of color options with named
<code>ae_catvar</code> variable for the severity analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><code>griddisplay</code>: Grid display option. This parameter
controls whether grid lines are displayed on the plot. Set it to “N” to
disable grid lines, and “Y” to enable them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of how <code>oncology tornado plot</code> is
called using the defined parameters:</p>
