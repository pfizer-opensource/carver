Clinical Analysis Reporting and Visualization Ensemble in R

## Purpose

To develop an open-source tool and package to enable generation of common analysis reports (tables and interactive plots) for clinical review and direct inclusion in submission for regulatory agencies. This includes a Shiny application for complete safety report generation from Analysis Model (ADaM) datasets.

## Dependencies

The latest version of the package works with the latest versions of the packages
stated in `DESCRIPTION`.

If a previous version of the package should be used, it is recommended to use
latest version of the dependencies at the point of time when the previous
version of {carver} was released.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package from GitHub by running:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pfizer-opensource/carver")
```


## Scope  

While {carver} aims to target several commonly used reports, it will not cover all reports needed for
a submission. Through collaboration across the industry we might achieve greater coverage, but it might never be exhaustive.
We encourage users to leverage these utilities to build their own specific reports additionally.  

* Build a toolbox of re-usable functions and utilities to create Clinical Domain tables and figures.
* Clinical Domain datasets which are used to create tables and figures should follow CDISC standards.
* Inclusion of relevant patient-level (patient profile) figures, accessible from overall results.
