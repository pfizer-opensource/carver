Adverse Events Summary Table
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Object passed to \code{datain} must be the output of \code{ae_pre_processor},
containing elements \code{dsin}, \code{dout} and \code{bigN}. Element \code{bigN} determines whether the
output table contains (N = count) appended to each Treatment Column. Elements
\code{dsin} and \code{dout} are used to calculate counts and percentages respectively.
\item Arguments \code{population} and \code{AE_Filter} are used only in report title and footnote.
They should be the same values passed previously in the \code{ae_pre_processor()} function.
\item If \code{summary_by} is "Patients", then the count used is the unique number of participants
per term; and if it is "Events", the count used is the total number of events observed per term.
\item Arguments \code{ui_lt} and \code{ui_ht} contain the lower and higher level Event variables.
The lower level variable will be grouped by higher level, so apt variables must be passed.
Examples (Low, High): AEDECOD/AEBODSYS, FMQ_NAM/AEBODSYS or AEDECOD/FMQ_NAM.
Passing AEBODSYS/AEDECOD or AEBODSYS/FMQ_NAM may not give expected results.
\item Passing "Y" to \code{riskyn} argument:
Includes pair-wise risk statistic given by \code{ui_statistics} (Risk Difference or Risk Ratio).
Only the treatments passed in \code{ctrlgrp} and \code{trtgrp} will be considered as the pair.
\code{ui_pctdisp} is automatically set to "TRT" (Risk/percent is calculated for each treatment)
\item Passing "N" to \code{riskyn} argument:
No risk statistic, only incidence counts and percentage are displayed for all treatments.
Arguments \code{ctrlgrp}, \code{trtgrp}, \code{ui_statistics} and \code{ui_alpha} are not required
Only "Count" and "Percent" are permitted for \code{ui_sortvar}.
\code{ui_pctdisp} determines the denominator to calculate \%. It can be "TRT"
(Denominator is Treatment total counts), "VAR" (Variable Total of all treatments/groups)
or "HT" (High Term uses Treatment counts and Low Term uses High Term counts per treatment)
\item \code{ui_sortopt} and \code{ui_sortvar} act together. For example, giving "Ascending" and
"Count" will sort the terms in ascending order of counts in the table.
If \code{ui_sortopt} is "Alphabetical", \code{ui_sortvar} is not considered.
